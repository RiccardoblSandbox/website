Quick Start
===

There are a variety of ways to use jMonkeyEngine:

* Download the SDK
* Download the engine
* Add the libraries to a build script

Using the Netbeans-based SDK is by far the quickest solution to get you up and running. Everything needed is provided, along with extra tools and integrations, and is generally the place most users start their endevour.
[Download the SDK](https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/sdk/releases).

jMonkeyEngine is not bound to any specific IDE or SDK, though, and if you feel comfortable in the Java environment you can use any IDE. The engine itself and it's dependencies can be downloaded directly and you can include them just like any other library in your java project.
[Download the Engine](https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/releases).

If you prefer to use online dependencies you can include them in your project from jcenter. This is the most common approach for users that use an IDE such as intellij.

repositories {
    jcenter()
}

dependencies {
    implementation "org.jmonkeyengine:jme3-core:3.2.3-stable"
    implementation "org.jmonkeyengine:jme3-desktop:3.2.3-stable"
    implementation "org.jmonkeyengine:jme3-lwjgl:3.2.3-stable"
}

Creating a Game
--

All games created with jmonkey start by extending `SimpleApplication`. Below is the most basic setup required to start your game and show a cube.

{{< highlight java >}}

package my.game;

import com.jme3.app.SimpleApplication;
import com.jme3.material.Material;
import com.jme3.math.ColorRGBA;
import com.jme3.scene.Geometry;
import com.jme3.scene.shape.Box;
import com.jme3.system.AppSettings;

public class Main extends SimpleApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Main app = new Main();

        AppSettings settings = new AppSettings(true);
        settings.setTitle("My Awesome Game");
        app.setSettings(settings);

        app.start();

    }

    @Override
    public void simpleInitApp() {

        Box b = new Box(1, 1, 1);
        Geometry geom = new Geometry("Box", b);

        Material mat = new Material(assetManager, "Common/MatDefs/Misc/Unshaded.j3md");
        mat.setColor("Color", ColorRGBA.Blue);
        geom.setMaterial(mat);

        rootNode.attachChild(geom);

    }

    @Override
    public void simpleUpdate(float tpf) {
        //TODO: add update code
    }

}

Running this class will start your first game and display a blue box on the screen, and you can move around using your mouse and WASD keys. Congratulations! You're running your first JME game!
